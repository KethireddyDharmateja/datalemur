Assume that you are given the table below containing information on viewership by device type (where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone). Define “mobile” as the sum of tablet and phone viewership numbers. Write a query to compare the viewership on laptops versus mobile devices.

Output the total viewership for laptop and mobile devices in the format of "laptop_views" and "mobile_views".

viewership Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
device_type	string ('laptop', 'tablet', 'phone')
view_time	timestamp
viewership Example Input:
user_id	device_type	view_time
123	tablet	01/02/2022 00:00:00
125	laptop	01/07/2022 00:00:00
128	laptop	02/09/2022 00:00:00
129	phone	02/09/2022 00:00:00
145	tablet	02/24/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
laptop_views	mobile_views
