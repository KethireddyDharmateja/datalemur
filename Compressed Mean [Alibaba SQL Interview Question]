You're trying to find the mean number of items per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal place using tables which includes information on the count of items in each order (item_count table) and the corresponding number of orders for each item count (order_occurrences table).

items_per_order Table:
Column Name	Type
item_count	integer
order_occurrences	integer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT
ROUND(CAST(SUM(order_occurrences * item_count)/SUM(order_occurrences) 
AS NUMERIC),1) AS mean
FROM items_per_order
